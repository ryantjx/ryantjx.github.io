        <h1>Welcome! / 欢迎! / ¡Bienvenidos! </h1>
        <p class="lead">I am Ryan Tan, a MSc Statistics student at the University of Warwick.</p>

        <p>I graduated with a BSc in Business Analytics (Honours) from the National University of Singapore (NUS).</p>  
        <p>I am passionate about machine learning models. I would like to create a model that can tell me the best decision to make at every moment of my life. My favourite podcast is not surprisingly titled <a href="https://www.flirtingwithmodels.com/">Flirting with Models</a>.</p>
        <p>Currently, I aim to pursue further research in areas such as Bayesian Inference and Optimal Control.</p>
        <!-- <p>I have always been fascinated by mathematical models that can explain and predict how the world behaves.</p>
        <p>My first encounter with this idea was through Snell's Law in Physics class when I was 14, which describes how light bends when passing between different media. 
        That experience sparked my interest in understanding how mathematical models can capture real phenomena, ultimately leading to my pursuit in computer science and statistics, learning about models and computational tools that allow us to model and infer the world’s underlying patterns.</p> -->

        <p>Aside from building mathematical models, I enjoy doing sports! 
        I used to play Volleyball and Ultimate Frisbee competitively. 
        Now, I am training for the Triathlon event, with the eventual goal of doing an <b>Ironman Triathlon</b>.</p>

        <p>I also enjoy being in the outdoors, taking any opportunity to hike or camp. 
        My most recent adventure was a <a href="https://ryanmula33.notion.site/12-day-hut-hiking-from-innsbruck-to-dolomites-san-martino-di-castrozza-36dd882976be4721a3c198340d94f6fd">12-day solo hike from Innsbruck to the Dolomites</a>. 
        My next target is the Pyreneese Mountains in the Summer of 2026.</p>

        <p>Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about my research, interests or just want to say hi!</p>

        <p>Note: Most of this area is still under construction...I will be updating it regularly over time!</p>
